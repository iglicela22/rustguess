# Rust Guessing Game

This is my first project built with Rust: a simple guessing game. The game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

### Features
- The program generates a random number.
- The player guesses the number by entering their input.
- The game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- It continues until the player guesses the correct number.

### Technologies Used
- **Rust**: A fast, memory-efficient language with strong type safety and concurrency support.

### What I Learned
Building this game helped me get hands-on experience with Rust's core concepts such as:
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if, loops)
- Handling user input and output
- Error handling with Rust's Result and Option types

It was a great project for learning Rust syntax and functionality while creating something interactive and fun!

### How to Run
To run the game:
1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository.
3. In the project directory, run:
   ```bash
   cargo run
